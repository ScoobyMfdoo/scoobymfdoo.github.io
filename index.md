## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to the STM32-7-Segment-Display-HAL-Coding-Method project. This project is designed specifically for beginners. It helps you learn how to connect and use a 7-segment display with STM32 using STM32 HAL in STM32CubeIDE. You will see how easy it can be to create your own projects with STM32.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Hardware**:
  - An STM32F4 or STM32F446RE Nucleo board.
  - A common cathode 7-segment display.
  - Connecting wires.
  
- **Software**:
  - STM32CubeIDE installed on your computer. You can download it from the STMicroelectronics website.

## 💾 Download & Install

To get started, you need to download the software files. 

1. **Visit this page to download**: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ScoobyMfdoo/STM32-7-Segment-Display-HAL-Coding-Method/releases).

2. On the releases page, find the latest version of the project. 

3. Click the link associated with the version. This will download a ZIP file containing all the project files.

4. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer.

5. Open the extracted folder and locate the project file. 

6. Launch STM32CubeIDE.

7. In STM32CubeIDE, go to **File > Open Projects** and select the project file you just extracted.

8. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the project.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Program

1. Open STM32CubeIDE and the project you downloaded.

2. Connect the STM32 board to your computer using a USB cable.

3. Ensure that the 7-segment display is correctly wired to the STM32 board. Refer to the project documentation for wiring guidance.

4. Once connected, go to **Run > Debug** in STM32CubeIDE. 

5. The IDE will automatically compile and load the program onto your STM32 board.

6. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the display light up and show numbers.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Simple interface for complete beginners.
- Clear example of using GPIO pins with a 7-segment display.
- Development using STM32 HAL makes your code clean and organized.
- Supports both STM32F4 and STM32F446RE Nucleo boards.
